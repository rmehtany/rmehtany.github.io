                            <p> One of the less pleasant parts of being home in these pandemic times has been listening to my younger sister gripe about her high school friendships, and all of the social faux pas she's made. The fact that this even makes my list of the worst parts of quarantine should tell you quite a lot about my quarantine experience. Yes, I've had several valued relatives pass too soon, and yes, I have (like most) felt the mental burden caused by the lockdowns, but when all is said and done, I've been extraordinarily lucky to have a comfortable home and stay-at-home job to keep me going during the pandemic.</p>
                            <p>
                                I don't think I've ever had an issue with acknowledging my fortunate circumstances. But there was a time when I was uncomfortable with sharing that awareness with others. I used to think that talking about my luck was at best lowering the value of my hard work, and just plain condescending. No one wants to hear an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_rl4ZGdy34' target='_blank' style='color:#0a37cc'>eight minute Macklemore song</a> about white privilege.</p>
				<p>I was reminded of all of this thanks to the video <i>Is success luck or hard work?</i> by Derek Muller. He notes that in surveyed married couples, the summed share of housework both partners believed they contributed to the household was on average 140%. This isn't particularly surprising: humans generally overrate their importance. What surprised me a bit more was the next statistic: when asked about what percentage of the domestic fights they caused, the sum of the percentages reported by couples was also around 140%. So this can't simply just be explained by arrogance.</p>
				<p>In fact, it's a simple consequence of how humans experience the world. We all experience all of the work, fights, and problems we cause, but don't observe all of the things that others do. So both good and bad, we overestimate how important our contribution to the world is.</p>
				<p>As a Malcolm Gladwell-esque example, Derek mentions the classic January phenomenon, the fact that a baby born in January is around four times as likely to make it in professional sports than a baby born in November. The explanation for this phenomenon is simple: January babies are slightly older than November babies in their respective grades, and that slight advantage grows as the more promising January baby athletes get access to resources the others don't.</p><p>But, if an athlete is asked about what got them there, they won't mention being born in January. They'll tell you about how supportive their parents were, how great a school they attended, the hard work they put in, etc.</p>
				<p>And this is why luck is so hard to diagnose in our lives. By definition, luck involves things we don't do, and thus do not see, while the hard work we do, by definition, are things we do and thus remember. One might remember the years of preparation it took to get that dream job, but not the coincedental car crash that eliminated a competitor.</p>
				<p>While reading some of the comments on the video, I found an interesting <a href='https://medium.com/the-launch-pad/what-makes-success-luck-vs-hard-work-d6887cb89de4' target='_blank' style='color:#0a37cc'>medium post</a> responding to the video, claiming that Derek was wrong, and that luck isn't involved in success at all, just your hard work.</p>
				<p>It's funny, because Derek mentions the exact mindset that the medium poster has. In order to become successful, one needs to establish a mindset of full confidence in one's abilities, and the belief that with enough work, anything is possible. As such, the advice provided in the post is great advice! It gives helpful tips about how to motivate oneself, keep active, and live a productive life.</p>
				<p>At the same time, the mindset is dead wrong. You can be as gritty as they come, but if you are born in Sierra Leone, there's no way you can overcome the opportunity gap of someone who is living in the US. In fact, the biggest luck lottery is just the place one is born, and the family one is born to. That can't be chalked up to "hard work".</p>
				<p>And this is why rich and successful people often aren't altruistic: if you believe that your fate is entirely in your hands, and the same holds for others, then poverty is just a consequence of laziness. Why encourage laziness with government programs like social security and the universal basic income? Just pick yourself up with your bootstraps.</p>
				<p>This mindset doesn't just hurt others, but also oneself. Derek mentioned that a study was conducted on how people viewed letters in which the writers credited their qualities for their achievements, versus those in which they didn't, and almost every time, the writer of the latter was viewed as more generous, more kind, and someone worth being around as compared to the former.</p>
				<p>I used to view my sister's self-blame for high school drama as a consequence of her being a teen, but it's no different than the self-importance all of us place on our actions due to the observation phenomenon. If there's anything that this video and the pandemic have taught me, it's how ridiculously lucky I am to know where my next meal is coming from.</p>
				<p>P.S. This is me over 4 years ago. Time does fly, huh.</p>
