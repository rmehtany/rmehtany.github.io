There are many ways to solve this. One is using Simon's Favorite Factoring trick: \((x+1)(y+1)=72\). Note that \((x+y)(xy)=880\), so \(x,y\) are both divisors of \(2^4\cdot5\cdot11\). Thus, \(x+1\neq72,36,18,8,4\). This leaves us with one possibility: \(x=5\), \(y=11\). We can check that this is in fact the solution (the other solution is just swapping the values). Thus, the answer is \(146\).
